\arguments{
\item{mat_data}{A gene-cell matrix of single cell expression data.}

\item{min.cells}{Include features detected in at least this many cells. Will subset the counts matrix as well. To reintroduce excluded features, create a new object with a lower cutoff. Default: 0.}

\item{min.features}{Include cells where at least this many features are detected. Default: 0.}

\item{normalization.method}{Method for normalization. Default: LogNormalize.}

\item{scale.factor}{Sets the scale factor for cell-level normalization. Default: 10000.}

\item{selection.method}{How to choose top variable features. Default: vst.}

\item{nfeatures}{Number of features to select as top variable features; only used when selection.method is set to 'dispersion' or 'vst'. Default: 2000.}

\item{mean.cutoff}{A two-length numeric vector with low- and high-cutoffs for feature means. Default: c(0.1, 8).}

\item{dispersion.cutoff}{A two-length numeric vector with low- and high-cutoffs for feature dispersions. Default: c(1, Inf).}

\item{features}{Vector of features names to scale/center. Default is variable features. Default: NULL.}

\item{vars.to.regress}{Variables to regress out (previously latent.vars in RegressOut). For example, nUMI, or percent.mito. Default: NULL.}

\item{npcs}{Total Number of PCs to compute and store (50 by default).}

\item{k.param}{Defines k for the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Default: 20.}

\item{dims}{Dimensions of reduction to use as input. Default: 1:10.}

\item{resolution}{Value of the resolution parameter, use a value above (below) 1.0 if you want to obtain a larger (smaller) number of communities. Default: 0.8.}

\item{n.neighbors}{This determines the number of neighboring points used in local approximations of manifold structure. Larger values will result in more global structure being preserved at the loss of detailed local structure. In general this parameter should often be in the range 5 to 50.}

\item{min.dist}{This controls how tightly the embedding is allowed compress points together. Larger values ensure embedded points are moreevenly distributed, while smaller values allow the algorithm to optimise more accurately with regard to local structure. Sensible values are in the range 0.001 to 0.5.}
